# Specification Quality Checklist: Graph documents are the sole source of edges

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-11-05
**Mission**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, C-### and SC-### entries, and match the requirement-ID grammar
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Every FR row and success criterion carries a delivery label and no-op mark
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Mission Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Mission meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The three [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are operator decisions deferred on #240 (comment
  6663603068). No operator is present in this cloud run; each marker has a recorded recommendation
  (Assumptions A-1 to A-3) that the plan builds on and keeps reversible. The markers are resolved
  when the operator answers, before the PR leaves draft.
- The contract and the operation name `putPackRelationship` are named because the ruling names
  them; they are the subject of the decision, not an implementation choice.
