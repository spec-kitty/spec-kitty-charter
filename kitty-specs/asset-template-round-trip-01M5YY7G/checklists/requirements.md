# Specification Quality Checklist: Asset and template round trip

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-10-27
**Mission**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Requirement types are separated (Functional / Non-Functional / Constraints)
- [x] IDs are unique across FR-###, NFR-###, C-### and SC-### entries, and match the requirement-ID grammar
- [x] All requirement rows include a non-empty Status value
- [x] Non-functional requirements include measurable thresholds
- [x] Every FR row and success criterion carries a delivery label and no-op mark
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Mission Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Mission meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec names domain artifacts (sidecar, file-kind rule, gate, fingerprint) because this is a service-internal
  mission whose stakeholders are pack authors and maintainers; no language, framework or class is named.
- NFR-003 names the repository's own gate command, which is the charter's merge gate, not an implementation choice.
